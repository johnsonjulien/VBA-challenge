Multi-Year Stock Analysis

In this project, you will find stock data recorded over the course of three years. As a part of this project, I was able to gather the overall yearly change and percentage change for each stock. This will be beneficial for evaluating stocks, not just on an annual basis but to compare over the course of time.

This stock analysis project is comprised of several different files including resources, test files as well as the final project:
•	Alphabetical_testing (this is where I tested the validity of my code before applying it to my final project)
•	Test_loop  (this is the original code I wrote for the test file before applying it to my final project)
•	Easy solution (this is a resource that was provided as a part of the initial project)
•	Moderate_Solution (this is a resource that was provided as a part of the initial project)
•	Hard_Solution (this is a resource that was provided as a bonus for the project)
•	Multiple_Year_Stock_Data (this is the Excel data as a part of the final project that the vba 
•	Stock_Data (this is the vba script to be run as a part of the final project)
•	MultiYearStock (this is a screenshot of the final results that I was able to gather)

This was definitely a challenge to work through and might not have figured out some of my errors without the help of my tutor, Sharon and input from our TA and my classmates. 

As you will see looking at the code for my project, I was unsuccessful at getting the data to compile for the greatest increases, decreases and greatest volume stocks for the entirety of the workbook. I hope to eventually find the formula that will return those results as I continue to research and familiarize myself with vba.
